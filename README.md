# COMPARATIVE DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION PREDICTION BENCHMARK STUDY

-----------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Overview

This repository contains all materials and resources for a benchmarking survey review study on predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) using graphical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches. The study focuses on published studies involving models of emerging drugs and integrates multimodal data such as molecular structures, pharmacological networks, and knowledge graphs to develop accurate and scalable prediction models.

## Objectives

- Explore graph-based, traditional ML, and DL approaches for DDI prediction.
- Compare the performance of a few select computational models using standardized metrics.
- Highlight the strengths and limitations of existing methodologies.
- Benchmark and rank the select models.

## Features

### Multimodal Data Integration:
Incorporates chemical structures, molecular networks, and biological pathways for robust predictions.

### Graph-Based Methods:

Utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) to uncover complex relationships between drugs.

### Traditional Machine Learning Models:
Includes logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines as baseline comparisons.

### Deep Learning Approaches:
Features state-of-the-art models such as DrugDrugIntact, MUFFIN, SumGNN, KGNN, and EmerGNN for improved prediction accuracy.
